              <p>A <b> Stiletto </b>is a specialized dagger with a long slender blade and needle-like point, primarily intended as a thrusting and stabbing weapon.
                The stiletto blade's narrow cross-section and acuminated tip reduce friction upon entry, allowing the blade to penetrate deeply. It was first designed in Italy.</p>
